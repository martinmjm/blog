# blog
This is the php source and css sheets for my blog. Basically written in php an communicating with mySQL database.
There is another css sheet (the main one for the website) and a header.html file, which this source is referring to; they can be found in the "website" repository. For some reason I have decided to keep them in separete repositories (maybe not a good idea and maybe I will merge them later on).
