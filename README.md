What is this
============

This is the php source and css sheets for my blog. Basically written in php an communicating with mySQL database. Live at marteno.eu/blog

Known issues
============

I know the database queries should be re-written with the new functions and prepared commands. I will do that some time in future. But for the time being I hope the sanitising of the input is satisfactory. Any feedback welcome.

There is another css sheet (the main one for the website) and a header.html file, which this source is referring to; they can be found in the "website" repository. For some reason I have decided to keep them in separete repositories (maybe not a good idea and maybe I will merge them later on).
